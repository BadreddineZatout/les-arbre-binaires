Philosophy reek hilosophia literally f wisdom is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence knowledge values reason mind and language The term was probably coined by Pythagoras CE Philosophical methods include questioning critical discussion rational argument and systematic presentation Classic philosophical questions include Is it possible to know anything and to prove it What is most real Philosophers also pose more practical and concrete questions such as Is there a best way to live Is it better to be just or unjust ne can get away with it Do humans have free will Historically ncompassed any body of knowledge From the time of Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle to the entury hilosophy encompassed astronomy medicine and physics For example Newtons athematical Principles of Natural Philosophy later became classified as a book of physics In the entury the growth of modern research universities led academic philosophy and other disciplines to professionalize and specialize In the modern era some investigations that were traditionally part of philosophy became separate academic disciplines including psychology sociology linguistics and economics Other investigations closely related to art science politics or other pursuits remained part of philosophy For example is beauty objective or subjective Are there many scientific methods or just one Is political utopia a hopeful dream or hopeless fantasy Major subfields of academic philosophy include metaphysics ith the fundamental nature of reality and being epistemology he nd grounds of knowledge imits and validity thics aesthetics political philosophy logic philosophy of science and the history of Western philosophy Since the entury professional philosophers contribute to society primarily as professors However many of those who study philosophy in undergraduate or graduate programs contribute in the fields of law journalism politics religion science business and various art

body of knowledge In this sense philosophy is closely related to religion mathematics natural science education and politics Newtons Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy is classified in the s a book of physics he used the term hilosophy because it used to encompass disciplines that later became associated with sciences such as astronomy medicine and physics In Classical antiquity Philosophy was traditionally divided into three major branches Natural philosophy as the study of the physical world it nature Moral philosophy as the study of goodness right and wrong beauty justice and virtue it custom Metaphysical philosophy as the study of existence causation God logic forms and other abstract objects it omes after physics This division is not obsolete but has changed Natural philosophy has split into the various natural sciences especially astronomy physics chemistry biology and cosmology Moral philosophy has birthed the social sciences but still includes value theory esthetics ethics political philosophy etc Metaphysical philosophy has birthed formal sciences such as logic mathematics and philosophy of science but still includes epistemology cosmology and others Philosophical progress Many philosophical debates that began in ancient times are still debated today Colin McGinn and others claim that no philosophical progress has occurred during that interval Chalmers and others by contrast see progress in philosophy similar to that in science while Talbot Brewer argued that s the wrong standard by which to judge philosophical activity Historical overview In one general sense philosophy is associated with wisdom intellectual culture and a search for knowledge In that sense all cultures and literate societies ask philosophical questions such as re we to live and s the nature of reality A broad and impartial conception of philosophy then finds a reasoned inquiry into such matters as reality morality and life in all world civilizations Western philosophy Main article Western philosophy Bust of Socrates in the Vatican Museum Western philosophy is the philosophical tradition of the Western world and dates to PreSocratic thinkers who were active in Ancient Greece in the entury BCE such as Thales CE and Pythagoras CE who practiced a f wisdom nd were also termed physiologoi f physis or nature Socrates was a very influential philosopher who insisted that he possessed no wisdom but was a pursuer of wisdom Western philosophy can be divided into three eras Ancient edieval philosophy uropean and Modern philosophy The Ancient era was dominated by Greek philosophical schools which arose out of the various pupils of Socrates such as Plato who founded the Platonic Academy and his student Aristotle founding the Peripatetic school who were both extremely influential in Western tradition Other traditions include Cynicism Stoicism Greek Skepticism and Epicureanism Important topics covered by the Greeks included metaphysics ompeting theories such as atomism and monism cosmology the nature of the welllived life he possibility of knowledge and the nature of reason ith the rise of the Roman empire Greek philosophy was also increasingly discussed in Latin by Romans such as Cicero and Seneca Medieval philosophy entury is the period following the fall of the western Roman empire and was dominated by the rise of Christianity and hence reflects JudeoChristian theological concerns as well as retaining a continuity with GrecoRoman thought Problems such as the existence and nature of God the nature of faith and reason metaphysics the problem of evil were discussed in this period Some key Medieval thinkers include St Augustine Thomas Aquinas Boethius Anselm and Roger Bacon Philosophy for these thinkers was viewed as an aid to Theology heologiae and hence they sought to align their philosophy with their interpretation of sacred scripture This period saw the development of Scholasticism a text critical method developed in medieval universities based on close reading and disputation on key texts The Renaissance eriod saw increasing focus on classic GrecoRoman thought and on a robust Humanism Early modern philosophy in the Western world begins with thinkers such as Thomas Hobbes and Rene Descartes ollowing the rise of natural science Modern philosophy was concerned with developing a secular and rational foundation for knowledge and moved away from traditional structures of authority such as religion scholastic thought and the Church Major modern philosophers include Spinoza Leibniz Locke Berkeley Hume and Kant hilosophy is influenced by the wider movement termed the Enlightenment and includes figures such as Hegel a key figure in German idealism Kierkegaard who developed the foundations for existentialism Nietzsche a famed antiChristian JS Mill who promoted Utilitarianism Karl Marx who developed the foundations for Communism and the American William James The entury saw

philosophical Wisdom literature and is today mostly dominated by Islamic culture Early wisdom literature from the fertile crescent was a genre which sought to instruct people on ethical action practical living and virtue through stories and proverbs In Ancient Egypt these texts were known as sebayt nd they are central to our understandings of Ancient Egyptian philosophy Babylonian astronomy also included much philosophical speculations about cosmology which may have influenced the Ancient Greeks Jewish philosophy and Christian philosophy are religiophilosophical traditions that developed both in the Middle East and in Europe which both share certain early Judaic texts he Tanakh and monotheistic beliefs Jewish thinkers such as the Geonim of the Talmudic Academies in Babylonia and Maimonides engaged with Greek and Islamic philosophy Later Jewish philosophy came under strong Western intellectual influences and includes the works of Moses Mendelssohn who ushered in the Haskalah ewish Enlightenment Jewish existentialism and Reform Judaism PreIslamic Iranian philosophy begins with the work of Zoroaster one of the first promoters of monotheism and of the dualism between good and evil This dualistic cosmogony influenced later Iranian developments such as Manichaeism Mazdakism and Zurvanism After the Muslim conquests Early Islamic philosophy developed the Greek philosophical traditions in new innovative directions This Islamic Golden Age influenced European intellectual developments The two main currents of early Islamic thought are Kalam which focuses on Islamic theology and Falsafa which was based on Aristotelianism and Neoplatonism The work of Aristotle was very influential among the falsafa such as alKindi entury Avicenna une nd Averroes entury Others such as AlGhazali were highly critical of the methods of the Aristotelian falsafa Islamic thinkers also developed a scientific method experimental medicine a theory of optics and a legal philosophy Ibn Khaldun was an influential thinker in philosophy of history In Iran several schools of Islamic philosophy continued to flourish after the Golden Age and include currents such as Illuminationist philosophy Sufi philosophy and Transcendent theosophy The nd entury Arab world saw the Nahda r renaissance movement which influenced contemporary Islamic philosophy Indian philosophy

the authority of the Vedas and whether they accept the theories of Brahman and Atman The orthodox schools generally include Nyaya Vaisheshika Samkhya Yoga Mms and Vedanta and the common heterodox schools are Jain Buddhist Ajana Ajivika and Crvka Some of the earliest surviving philosophical texts are the Upanishads of the later Vedic period CE Important Indian philosophical concepts include dharma karma samsara moksha and ahimsa Indian philosophers developed a system of epistemological reasoning nd logic and investigated topics such as metaphysics ethics hermeneutics and soteriology Indian philosophy also covered topics such as political philosophy as seen in the Arthashastra c entury BCE and the philosophy of love as seen in the Kama Sutra The commonly named six orthodox schools arose sometime between the start of the Common Era and the Gupta Empire These Hindu schools developed what has been called the ynthesis merging orthodox Brahmanical and unorthodox elements from Buddhism and Jainism as a way to respond to the unorthodox challenges Hindu thought also spread east to the Indonesian Srivijaya empire and the Cambodian Khmer Empire Later developments include the development of Tantra and IranianIslamic influences Buddhism mostly disappeared from India after the Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent surviving in the Himalayan regions and south India The early modern period saw the flourishing of NavyaNyya new reason under philosophers such as Raghunatha Siromani ho founded the tradition Jayarama Pancanana Mahadeva Punatamakara and Yashovijaya

Analects of Confucius CE Kitar Nishida professor of philosophy at Kyoto University and founder of the Kyoto School East Asian philosophical thought began in Ancient China and Chinese philosophy begins during the Western Zhou Dynasty and the following periods after its fall when the chools of Thought flourished entury to CE This period was characterized by significant intellectual and cultural developments and saw the rise of the major philosophical schools of China Confucianism Legalism and Daoism as well as numerous other less influential schools These philosophical traditions developed

that of Dogen African philosophy Main article African philosophy African philosophy is philosophy produced by African people philosophy that presents African worldviews ideas and themes or philosophy that uses distinct African philosophical methods Modern African thought has been occupied with Ethnophilosophy with defining the very meaning of African philosophy and its unique characteristics and what it means to be African During the entury Ethiopian philosophy developed a robust literary tradition as exemplified by Zera Yacob Another early African philosopher was Anton Wilhelm Amo ho became a respected philosopher in Germany Distinct African philosophical ideas include Ujamaa the Bantu idea of egritude PanAfricanism and Ubuntu Contemporary African thought has also seen the development of Professional philosophy and of Africana philosophy the philosophical literature of the African diaspora which includes currents such as black existentialism by AfricanAmericans Modern African thinkers have been influenced by Marxism AfricanAmerican literature Critical theory Critical race theory Postcolonialism and Feminism Indigenous American philosophy Main article Indigenous American philosophy The Aztec Sun Stone also known as the Aztec Calendar Stone at National Museum of Anthropology Mexico City Indigenous American philosophy is the philosophy of the Indigenous people of the Americas There is a wide variety of beliefs and traditions among these different American cultures Among some of the Native Americans in the United States there is a belief in a metaphysical principle called the ystery akan Tanka Algonquian Gitche Manitou Another widely shared concept was that of Orenda or ower According to Peter M Whiteley for the Native Americans s critically informed by transcendental experience isions and so on as well as by reason The practices to access these transcendental experiences are termed Shamanism Another feature of the indigenous American worldviews was their extension of ethics to nonhuman animals and plants In Mesoamerica Aztec philosophy was an intellectual tradition developed by individuals called Tlamatini ho know something nd its ideas are preserved in various Aztec codices The Aztec worldview posited the concept of an ultimate universal energy or force called Ometeotl which can be translated as osmic Energy and sought a way to live in balance with a constantly changing orld The theory of Teotl can be seen as a form of Pantheism Aztec philosophers developed theories of metaphysics epistemology values and aesthetics Aztec ethics was focused on seeking tlamatiliztli isdom which was based on moderation and balance in all actions as in the Nahua proverb iddle good is necessary The Inca civilization also had an elite class of philosopherscholars termed the Amawtakuna who were important in the Inca education system as teachers of religion tradition history and ethics Key concepts of Andean thought are Yanantin and Masintin which involve a theory of pposites that sees polarities s malefemale darklight as interdependent parts of a harmonious whole Categories Philosophical questions can be grouped into categories These groupings allow philosophers to focus on a set of similar topics and interact with other thinkers who are interested in the same questions The groupings also make philosophy easier for students to approach Students can learn the basic principles involved in one aspect of the field without being overwhelmed with the entire set of philosophical theories Various sources present different categorical schemes The categories adopted in this article aim for breadth and simplicity These five major branches can be separated into subbranches and each subbranch contains many specific fields of study Metaphysics and epistemology Value theory Science logic and mathematics History of Western philosophy Philosophical traditions These divisions are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive hilosopher might specialize in Kantian epistemology or Platonic aesthetics or modern political philosophy Furthermore these philosophical inquiries sometimes overlap with each other and with other inquiries such as science religion or mathematics Metaphysics Main article Metaphysics Metaphysics is the study of the most general features of reality such as existence time objects and their properties wholes and their parts events processes and causation and the relationship between mind and body Metaphysics includes cosmology the study of the world in its entirety and ontology the study of being A major point of debate is between realism which holds that there are entities that exist independently of their mental perception and idealism which holds that reality is mentally constructed or otherwise immaterial Metaphysics deals with the topic of identity Essence is the set of attributes that make an object what it fundamentally is and without which it loses its identity while accident is a property that the object has without which the object can still retain its identity Particulars are objects that are said to exist in space and time as opposed to abstract objects such as numbers and universals which are properties held by multiple particulars such as redness or a gender The type of existence if any of universals and abstract objects is an issue of debate Epistemology Main article Epistemology Dignaga founded a school of Buddhist epistemology and logic Epistemology is the study of knowledge pisteme Epistemologists study the putative sources of knowledge including intuition a priori reason memory perceptual knowledge selfknowledge and testimony They also ask What is truth Is knowledge justified true belief Are any beliefs justified Putative knowledge includes propositional knowledge hat something is the case knowhow f how to do something and acquaintance ith someone or something Epistemologists examine these and ask whether knowledge is really possible Skepticism is the position which doubts claims to knowledge The regress argument a fundamental problem in epistemology occurs when in order to completely prove any statement its justification itself needs to be supported by another justification This chain can go on forever called infinitism it can eventually rely on basic beliefs that are left unproven called foundationalism or it can go in a circle so that a statement is included in its own chain of justification called coherentism Rationalism is the emphasis on reasoning as a source of knowledge It is associated with a priori knowledge which is independent of experience such as math and logical deduction Empiricism is the emphasis on observational evidence via sensory experience as the source of knowledge Among the numerous topics within metaphysics and epistemology broadly construed are Philosophy of language explores the nature the origins and the use of language Philosophy of mind explores the nature of the mind and its relationship to the body It is typified by disputes between dualism and materialism In recent years this branch has become related to cognitive science Philosophy of human nature analyzes the unique characteristics of human beings such as rationality politics and culture Metaphilosophy explores the aims of philosophy its boundaries and its methods Value theory Value theory xiology is the major branch of philosophy that addresses topics such as goodness beauty and justice Value theory includes ethics aesthetics political philosophy feminist philosophy philosophy of law and more Ethics Main article Ethics The Beijing imperial college was an intellectual center for Confucian ethics and classics during the Yuan Ming and Qing dynasties Ethics or hilosophy studies and considers what is good and bad conduct right and wrong values and good and evil Its primary investigations include how to live a good life and identifying standards of morality It also includes metainvestigations about whether a best way to live or related standards exists The main branches of ethics are normative ethics metaethics and applied ethics A major area of debate involves consequentialism in which actions are judged by the potential results of the act such as to maximize happiness called utilitarianism and deontology in which actions are judged by how they adhere to principles irrespective of negative ends Aesthetics Main article Aesthetics Aesthetics is the eflection on art culture and nature It addresses the nature of art beauty and taste enjoyment emotional values perception and with the creation and appreciation of beauty It is more precisely defined as the study of sensory or sensoriemotional values sometimes called judgments of sentiment and taste Its major divisions are art theory literary theory film theory and music theory An example from art theory is to discern the set of principles underlying the work of a particular artist or artistic movement such as the Cubist aesthetic The philosophy of film analyzes films and filmmakers for their philosophical content and explores film inema etc as a medium for philosophical reflection and expressioncitation needed Political philosophy Main article Political philosophy Thomas Hobbes Political philosophy is the study of government and the relationship of individuals amilies and clans to communities including the state It includes questions about justice law property and the rights and obligations of the citizen Politics and ethics are traditionally linked subjects as both discuss the question of how people should live together Other branches of value theory Philosophy of law alled jurisprudence explores the varying theories explaining the nature and interpretation of laws Philosophy of education analyzes the definition and content of education as well as the goals and challenges of educators Feminist philosophy explores questions surrounding gender sexuality and the body including the nature of feminism itself as a social and philosophical movement Philosophy of sport analyzes sports games and other forms of play as sociological and uniquely human activities Logic science and mathematics Many academic disciplines generated philosophical inquiry The relationship between nd the f X is debated Richard Feynman argued that the philosophy of a topic is irrelevant to its primary study saying that f science is as useful to scientists as ornithology is to birds Curtis White by contrast argued that philosophical tools are essential to humanities sciences and social sciences The topics of philosophy of science are numbers symbols and the formal methods of reasoning as employed in the social sciences and natural sciences Logic Main article Logic Logic is the study of reasoning and argument An argument is onnected series of statements intended to establish a proposition The connected series of statements are nd the proposition is the conclusion For example All humans are mortal ocrates is a human herefore Socrates is mortal eductive reasoning is when given certain premises conclusions are unavoidably implied Rules of inference are used to infer conclusions such as modus ponens where given nd hen B then ust be concluded Because sound reasoning is an essential element of all sciences social sciences and humanities disciplines logic became a formal science Subfields include mathematical logic philosophical logic Modal logic computational logic and nonclassical logics A major question in the philosophy of mathematics is whether mathematical entities are objective and discovered called mathematical realism or invented called mathematical antirealism Philosophy of science Main article Philosophy of science This branch explores the foundations methods history implications and purpose of science Many of its subdivisions correspond to a specific branch of science For example philosophy of biology deals specifically with the metaphysical epistemological and ethical issues in the biomedical and life sciences The philosophy of mathematics studies the philosophical assumptions foundations and implications of mathematics History of philosophy See also Metaphilosophy and History of ethics Further information Philosophical progress and List of years in philosophy Some philosophers specialize in one or more historical periods The history of philosophy f a specific period individual or school is related to but not the same as the philosophy of history heoretical aspect of history which deals with questions such as the nature of historical evidence and the possibility of objectivity Hegels Lectures on the Philosophy of History influenced many philosophers to interpret truth in light of history a view called historicism Philosophy of religion Main article Philosophy of religion Philosophy of religion deals with questions that involve religion and religious ideas from a philosophically neutral perspective pposed to theology which begins from religious convinctions Traditionally religious questions were not seen as a separate field from philosophy proper the idea of a separate field only arose in the entury Issues include the existence of God the relationship between reason and faith questions of religious epistemology the relationship between religion and science how to interpret religious experiences questions about the possibility of an afterlife the problem of religious language and the existence of souls and responses to religious pluralism and diversity Philosophical schools Some philosophers specialize in one or more of the major philosophical schools such as Continental philosophy Analytical philosophy Thomism Asian philosophy or African philosophy Other approaches A variety of other academic and nonacademic approaches have been explored Applied philosophy Martin Luther King Jr The ideas conceived by a society have profound repercussions on what actions the society performs Weaver argued that ideas have consequences Philosophy yields applications such as those in ethics pplied ethics in particular nd political philosophy The political and economic philosophies of Confucius Sun Tzu Chanakya Ibn Khaldun Ibn Rushd Ibn Taymiyyah Machiavelli Leibniz Hobbes Locke Rousseau Adam Smith John Stuart Mill Marx Tolstoy Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr have been used to shape and justify governments and their actions Progressive education as championed by Dewey had a profound impact on entury US educational practices Descendants of this movement include efforts in philosophy for children which are part of philosophy education Clausewitzs political philosophy of war has had a profound effect on statecraft international politics and military strategy in the entury especially around World War II Logic is important in mathematics linguistics psychology computer science and computer engineering Other important applications can be found in epistemology which aid in understanding the requisites for knowledge sound evidence and justified belief n law economics decision theory and a number of other disciplines The philosophy of science discusses the underpinnings of the scientific method and has affected the nature of scientific investigation and argumentation Philosophy thus has fundamental implications for science as a whole For example the strictly empirical approach of B F Skinners behaviorism affected for decades the approach of the American psychological establishment Deep ecology and animal rights examine the moral situation of humans as occupants of a world that has nonhuman occupants to consider also Aesthetics can help to interpret discussions of music literature the plastic arts and the whole artistic dimension of life In general the various philosophies strive to provide practical activities with a deeper understanding of the theoretical or conceptual underpinnings of their fields Society Some of those who study philosophy become professional philosophers typically by working as professors who teach research and write in academic institutions However most students of academic philosophy later contribute to law journalism religion sciences politics business or various arts For example public figures who have degrees in philosophy include comedians Steve Martin and Ricky Gervais filmmaker Terrence Malick Pope John Paul II Wikipedia cofounder Larry Sanger technology entrepreneur Peter Thiel Supreme Court Justice Stephen Bryer and vice presidential candidate Carly Fiorina Recent efforts to avail the general public to the work and relevance of philosophers include the milliondollar Berggruen Prize first awarded to Charles Taylor in rofessional Germany was the first country to professionalize philosophy At the end of egel was the first philosopher to be appointed Professor by the State namely by the Prussian Minister of Education as an effect of Napoleonic reform in Prussia In the United States the professionalisation grew out of reforms to the American highereducation system largely based on the German model Bertrand Russell Within the last century philosophy has increasingly become a professional discipline practiced within universities like other academic disciplines Accordingly it has become less general and more specialized In the view of one prominent recent historian as become a highly organized discipline done by specialists primarily for other specialists The number of philosophers has exploded the volume of publication has swelled and the subfields of serious philosophical investigation have multiplied Not only is the broad field of philosophy today far too vast to be embraced by one mind something similar is true even of many highly specialized subfields Some philosophers argue that this professionalization has negatively affected the discipline The end result of professionalization for philosophy has meant that work being done in the field is now almost exclusively done by university professors holding a doctorate in the field publishing in highly technical peerreviewed journals While it remains common among the population at large for a person to have a set of religious political or philosophical views that they consider their hese views are rarely informed by or connected to the work being done in professional philosophy today Furthermore unlike many of the sciences for which there has come to be a healthy industry of books magazines and television shows meant to popularize science and communicate the technical results of a scientific field to the general populace works by professional philosophers directed at an audience outside the profession remain rare Philosopher Michael Sandels book Justice Whats the Right Thing to Do and Harry Frankfurts On Bullshit are examples of works that hold the uncommon distinction of having been written by professional philosophers but directed at and ultimately popular among a broader audience of nonphilosophers Both works became ork Times best sellers Nonprofessional Many inquiries outside of academia are philosophical in the broad sense Novelists playwrights filmmakers and musicians as well as scientists and others engage in recognizably philosophical activity Ayn Rand is the foremost example of an intellectual working contemporaneously with contemporary philosophy but whose contributions were not made within the professional discipline of For all her ands popularity however only a few professional philosophers have taken her work seriously As a result most of the serious philosophical work on Rand has appeared in nonacademic nonpeerreviewed journals or in books and the bibliography reflects this fact Also working from outside the profession were philosophers such as Gerd B Achenbach eine und die praktische Philosophie Drei Vortrge zur philosophischen Praxis nd Michel Weber is Epreuve de la philosophie ho have proposed since the arious forms of philosophical counseling claiming to bring Socratic dialogues back to life in a quasipsychotherapeutic framework Pierre Hadot is famous for his analysis on the conception of philosophy during GrecoRoman antiquity Hadot identified and analyzed the xercises used in ancient philosophy ichel Foucaults interest in such practices in the second and third volumes of his History of Sexuality By xercises Hadot means ntended to effect a modification and a transformation in the subjects who practice them The philosophy teachers discourse could be presented in such a way that the disciple as auditor reader or interlocutor could make spiritual progress and transform himself within Hadot shows that the key to understanding the original philosophical impulse is to be found in Socrates What characterizes Socratic therapy above all is the importance given to living contact between human beings Hadots recurring theme is that philosophy in antiquity was characterized by a series of spiritual exercises intended to transform the perception and therefore the being of those who practice it that philosophy is best pursued in real conversation and not through written texts and lectures and that philosophy as it is taught in universities today is for the most part a distortion of its original therapeutic impulse He brings these concerns together in What Is Ancient Philosophy which has been critically reviewed Role of women Main article Women in philosophy American philosopher of mind and philosopher of art Susanne Langer lthough men have generally dominated philosophical discourse women have engaged in philosophy throughout history Women philosophers have contributed since ancient timesnotably Hipparchia of Maroneia CE and Arete of Cyrene thth century BCE More were accepted during the ancient medieval and modern eras but no women philosophers became part the Western canon until the nd entury when some sources indicate that Susanne Langer Hannah Arendt and Simone de Beauvoir entered the canon In the early ome colleges and universities in the UK and US began admitting women producing more female academics Nevertheless US Department of Education reports from the ndicate that few women ended up in philosophy and that philosophy is one of the least genderproportionate fields in the humanities In nside Higher Education described the philosophy wn long history of misogyny and sexual harassment of women students and professors University of Sheffield philosophy professor Jennifer Saul stated in hat women are hilosophy after being harassed assaulted or retaliated against In the early he Canadian Philosophical Association noted a gender imbalance and gender bias in the academic field of philosophy In June S sociology professor stated that f all recent citations in four prestigious philosophy journals female authors comprise just ercent of the total Susan Price argues that the philosophical emains dominated by white males he discipline thatstill hews to the myth that genius is tied to gender Morgan Thompson suggests that discrimination differences in abilities grade differences and the lack of role models in philosophy could be potential factors for the gender gap According to Saul he oldest of the humanities is also the malest he whitest While other areas of the humanities are at or near gender parity philosophy is actually more overwhelmingly male than even mathematics Popular culture In he Open Court Publishing Company began publishing a series of books on philosophy and popular culture Each book consists of essays written by philosophers for general readers The books he meanings concepts and puzzles within television shows movies music and other icons of popular culture analyzing topics such as the TV
